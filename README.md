### Dataset

The original dataset can be downloaded from the [Danbooru 2018 Anime Character Recognition Dataset](https://github.com/grapeot/Danbooru2018AnimeCharacterRecognitionDataset). We then remove those black-white or grayscale images with `preprocess.py` since their inclusion increases the instability in GAN's training.
